      <h3>A Brief History Of Stephen William Hawking</h3>
      <p>
        Stephen William Hawking was a British physicist, born on 8th January
        1942. He is considered the most brilliant theoretical physicist of all
        time. He revolutionized the field of physics through his work on the
        origin of the universe and the black hole explosion theory. From the big
        bang to black holes, all his best-selling books appealed to physics
        lovers across the globe.<br />
        The English theoretical physicist whose theory of the explosion of black
        holes illustrated upon the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.
        He also worked in the field of space-time singularities. <br />
        Stephen William Hawking studied physics in 1962 at the University
        College, Cambridge and in 1966 in the Trinity Hall, Cambridge,. His
        contributions in physics are unparalleled, which often left other
        scientists scratching their heads. Professor Stephen William Hawking
        holds 13 honorary degrees. He was bestowed CBE (1982), Fellow of Honor
        (1989) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2009). He has received the
        Fundamental Physics Award (2013), the Copley Medal (2006) and the Wolf
        Foundation Award (1988). Along with a bunch of other honours awards and
        medals, he won the Adams Prize in 1966 for his essay Singularities and
        the Space-time Geometry.

            <p>
              Building on his earlier work, Hawking discusses imaginary time,
              how black holes can give birth to baby universes, and scientists'
              efforts to find a complete unified theory that would predict
              everything in the universe.

            <h2>A Brief History of Time</h2>
            <p>
              In A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking attempts to explain a
              range of subjects in cosmology, including the Big Bang, black
              holes and light cones, to the non-specialist reader. He also
              attempts to explain some complex mathematics.

            <p>
              In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory,
              the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but
              rather that every possible history of the universe exists
              simultaneously.

            <h2>The Universe in a Nutshell</h2>
            <p>
              In his accessible and often playful style, he guides us on his
              search to uncover the secrets of the universe - from supergravity
              to supersymmetry, from quantum theory to M-theory, from holography
              to duality.
